			<h3><strong>The Way of Return</strong></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The process of reuniting the incarnate human personality with its divine Source.</li>
					<li>Just as the universe (and each human being) was created in a 'top down' process descending from <em>Kether</em>, so must each human seek to return to God in an upward path from <em>Malkuth</em>.</li>
					<li>By retracing the process through which we came into being, we may discover the divine nature within us, and transcend the limitations of physical existence.</li>
					<li>The beginnings of the Way of Return may be visualised as the construction of a cup, the raw material being the human personality in its inert, unexalted state.</li>
					<li>The purpose of the human personality is to become a literal container for the 'liquid' of divine inspiration.</li>

			<h3><strong>From <em>Malkuth</em> to <em>Kether</em></strong></h3>
			We must fashion ourselves as a balanced, stable cup, with no holes and a sturdy base, if we are to be successful. We must equilibrate our personality, and eliminate those defects in "construction" which would hamper our receptivity to the divine.<br><br>
			Carl Jung believed we should strive for balance of the four functions of personality: <strong>sensation</strong>, <strong>intuition</strong>, <strong>thinking</strong> and <strong>feeling</strong>.<br><br>
			Similarly, the first four steps on the <strong>Way of Return</strong> -- that is, the passage through the spheres of <em><strong>Malkuth</strong></em>, <em><strong>Yesod</strong></em>, <em><strong>Hod</strong></em> and <em><strong>Netzach</strong></em> -- can be seen as an equilibration of the aspects of human existence to which they correspond.<br><br>
			In the Hermetic Qabalah, the spheres are attributed to <strong>Earth</strong>, <strong>Air</strong>, <strong>Water</strong> and <strong>Fire</strong>, respectively.<br><br>
			Psychologically speaking, these represent the faculties of <strong>sensation</strong>, <strong>common intuition</strong>, <strong>intellect</strong>, and <strong>emotion</strong> or <strong>desire</strong>, paralleling Jung's functions mentioned above.<br><br>
			It is only when these aspects of the lower human personality are brought into balance that the vessel is prepared for the conscious influx of the divine light.<br><br>
			The fifth step on the <strong>Way of Return</strong> brings the Qabalist to the sphere of <em>Tiphereth</em>, at the centre of the <strong>Tree of Life</strong>.
			This stage marks the literal dawning of the spiritual light, for indeed <em>Tiphereth</em> is the sphere attributed to the sun in Hermetic Qabalah.<br><br>
			Having fashioned a suitable vessel, the Qabalist has in essence performed an invocation to the highest forces within himself, inviting that divine light to take up residence in the formerly mundane human life.<br><br>
			The <strong>Way of Return</strong> beyond <em>Tiphereth</em> is marker by a progressively more intimate relationship between the lower human personality and the divine.
			If the steps before <em>Tiphereth</em> were somewhat like a courtship, and attainment of <em>Tiphereth</em> a wedding, then the remaining Way of Return can be likened to the ongoing marital relationship.<br><br>
			In the Hermetic Qabalah, tradition holds that this ongoing relationship between the personality and the divine brings all the benefits associated with psychological and spiritual growth: a sense of purpose and meaning, inner peace, harmony between the self and the world, and the ability to mobilise more fully our inner resources in service of our life goals, for the benefit of ourselves and humanity.

			<h3><strong>Practical Applications</strong></h3>
			The model of the <strong>Tree of Life</strong>, with all its paths and spheres, is a complex and flexible symbolic system.<br>
			Since each path and sphere embodies a certain quality or process, it is possible to develop a personal system of classification of life experiences based on the Tree.<br><br>
			<strong>E.g.</strong> A student might wish to gain greater understanding of the workings of his or her personality. To accomplish this, he/she might begin a daily journal in which he monitors his daily experiences and classifies them according to the four lowest sephiroth on the Tree. After a few days or weeks of this monitoring, it is likely that patterns, biases, overemphasised tendencies would become apparent, and corrective steps could be taken.<br><br>
			<strong>E.g.</strong> A student might wish to gain insight into the higher principles of Mercy (<em>Chesed</em>) and Severity (<em>Geburah</em>) operating in their life. They would monitor outer and inner experiences and classify each as either expansive, peaceful and growth-promoting (<em>Chesed</em>), or as energetic, severe and seemingly restrictive (<em>Geburah</em>). Thus they might gain a greater appreciation for the ebb and flow of these opposing forces not only in their own personality, but also in the life events that shape their experience each day.
			This type of practice, when pursued with brutal honesty and conscious intent, can potentially lead to even more exalted levels of consciousness -- direct awareness of the spiritual self within, of the nature of life, and of the interconnectedness of the universe as a whole.
