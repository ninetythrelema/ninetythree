			<h3><strong>The Creation of the Universe</strong></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The creation of the universe is a series of progressive emanations of deity.</li>
					<li>They originate in the great nothingness, <em>ain</em>, and gradually take the form of ten sephiroth and twenty-two paths that connect them.</li>
					<li>The Tree of Life not only represents the process of creation -- it is also a depiction of the 'mind of God' and by coming into an understanding of its varied aspects, Qabalists believe they draw closer to divinity itself.</li>
					<li>The ten sephiroth symbolise all possible states of being, and they form an all-inclusive catalogue of the ideas and manifestations of the divine Mind.</li>
					<li>The paths, meanwhile, show the states of change and flux between these states of being.</li>
					<li>The progression from <em>Kether</em> to <em>Malkuth</em> involves the descent of the divine from the primal, singular point of <em>Kether</em>, through the archetypal realities associated with the spheres of <em>Chokmah</em> through <em>Yesod</em>, and culminating in the physical, manifest universe at <em>Malkuth</em>.</li>
					<li>With each step downward, the divine becomes increasingly dense and multi-faceted, as it takes on the characteristics of each successive sephira.</li> 
				</ul>
