			<h3><strong>The Holy Guardian Angel</strong></h3>

			In the system of A...A..., from the very beginning, the path towards <em><strong>Knowledge and Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel</strong></em> is of singular importance. Tool such as: magical rituals, meditation, the gradual raising of the <em>kundalini</em> through various practices, devotional practices, and so on; are used as stepping stones towards <strong>K&C</strong>.<br><br>

			After the <strong>K&C</strong>, when the knowledge of the <strong>True Will</strong> is consciously and deeply ingrained in our everyday living, we can choose to do a magical ritual and be assured that it is in line with our True Will. This is rarely the case before <strong>K&C</strong>.<br><br>

			Unfortunately, this fact has often caused people to ignore basic training in ritual and other practices because they believe that they are not going to 'get it right' until they've had <strong>K&C</strong>. It is essential to remember that the only way we learn to do things is through experimentation. No one at the beginning of the path is going to have the level of insight into their tools, their methods, or their <strong>True Will</strong> that further attainment will bring. So start wherever you are, practice, make mistakes, learn from them...and <strong>WRITE IT ALL DOWN IN YOUR DIARY!</strong><br><br>

			Generally, there is a gradually increasing intimacy of communication and understanding that begins early on with the <strong>HGA</strong>. <br><br>
			We feel the impulses and subtle urgings of the Angel in dreams, intuitive flashes, and synchronistic events.<br><br>
			In those moments, when we seem to be receiving impulses from a deep level of consciousness or we have an abiding sense of the rightness of a certain choice, we are seeing a glimmer of the <strong>HGA</strong>.<br><br>
			Likewise, our strivings for beauty in our lives, our drive to be enraptured in the things and the people we love--all of these are glimmers of the Angel as well.<br><br>

			Early on, our communication with the <strong>HGA</strong> comes through our own unconscious mind, and in the language of symbol.<br>
			One must gradually improve their ability to speak the language of symbol to being to have conscious conversation with the <strong>HGA</strong>.<br><br>

			The defining characteristic of the adept is that he or she can communicate with the Angel consciously and at will. What is this process like? It is essentially the ability to differentiate that one voice of the <strong>HGA</strong> from all the other voices that speak to us in various ways in our lives. <br><br>

			<em><strong>The Great Work</strong></em>, quite simply, is all about getting your head in the right place--the receptive awareness of <em>Tiphereth</em>--so that the crown of <em>Kether</em> can be placed on your head.<br><br>

			Many aspirants find that the process of moving towards <strong>K&C</strong> consists of successive layers of instruction in the methods of properly invoking the Angel. <br>
			You will very likely discover that everything you are, everything you have been, and everything you love and find beautiful, will be utilised as a tool in the invocation of your <strong>HGA</strong>.<br><br>

			As long as you are forging ahead with the great tasks, as long as you are enflaming yourself in prayer, invoking often, devoting yourself to pushing ahead on the path towards <strong>K&C</strong>, you will undergo these successive layers of instruction from the <strong>HGA</strong>.<br>
			You will get a name, an impulse to pursue a particular line of work, a mode of meditation, or other such tools.<br>
			You may find that later on, you receive additional instruction that supersedes or completely overturns what was given to you before. That's the nature of this Work: as you refine your tools of reception, as you get better at finding that one voice, you will quite naturally cast aside some of the things that you've been given earlier. If you persist, you will refine your own tools to enable you to hear and recognise the voice of the Angel clearly, and at exactly the right time.<br><br>

			<strong>LISTEN TO YOUR HGA AS SOON AS YOU FEEL YOU'VE HAD COMMUNICATION WITH IT.</strong><br><br>
